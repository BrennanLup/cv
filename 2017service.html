<body class="2017service">The Lang Scholar Program at UCC wanted to make a difference and give back to the community so we decided to create a service project. Being a Lang Scholar requires a strong academic, athletic, and community service involvement and we wanted to
    create a program that reflected what we represent. We reached out to a nearby public school, Winchester public school, which is in a less privileged part of the city to see if we could work with them. We decided that for a number of Fridays
    between January and March we would spend time with one of the classes their, and after the program finished, leave them a generous gift. We formed three groups, each one led by a lang scholar, for each visit and created a new activity to do each
    time we went. In addition, we read a book which we asked them to read over the december break so we could discuss with them, and we had snack and chatted for the rest of the time. The entire experience was truly remarkable, seeing the excitement
    on their face when we brought bagels and fruit for snack, and how happy they were during the games was nothing like I had experienced. Although, it did start off difficult as we had a group of roughly 8 students to ourselves and had to control
    them during the game and get them to listen to you. Over the weeks it got easier but I learned how difficult it can be to get younger people and people closer in age with you to listen. However, despite the challenges it was an extremely
    rewarding experience. We had some money for a donation and asked them to do an assignment where they created a list of items of what they wanted for their school as well as the total cost and a paragraph as to why they needed it. We made one last
    visit to the school to deliver the gifts after we had reviewed and decided what to get them and their reaction to the gifts was truly heartwarming and not like anything I had ever felt before. They were so genuinely happy to have a few soccer
    balls, guitars and a few other items, I could see we clearly impacted their lives. In short, this project taught me a great deal about myself and how to work with children, but most importantly, the joy in giving back and having a positive impact
    on someone else. Lastly, to make things even better, one of the kids we worked with is applying to UCC and may come here which would literally change his life through the opportunity he is receiving, which was made possible through our project.
